        <!-- paragraph  -->
        <p class="w-50 para-history">Smt MCP Sanskar Vidya Bhavan held its Annual Sports Week from 4th January 2020 to
            7th January 2020. The aim behind holding the event was to inculcate the spirit of sportsmanship and fondness
            for sports in children. The event was a fun filled fest of energy and delight.

            Mrs. Sharmila Das the Principal Smt.MCP Sanskar Vidya Bhavan, Mrs. Falguni Naik the Principal J B Mody
            Vidyalaya and Mrs.Jasmin Modi Incharge Radha Bal Vatika graced the event and motivated the students.

            The inaugration of the event began with the spectacular torch â€“ bearing ceremony conducted by the young
            sports achievers of our school. The Sports Flame was lit by Mrs. Jasmin Modi and the sports week was
            formally declared open by her.
            
            Yogic asanas demonstrated by the students lent a serene aura to the event.

            The first event of the Sports Week was Fancy Races for Students of Std I to Std V followed by Athletic
            events for Std VI and VII. Once the event began, the air was filled with cheering and tons of encouragement
            .

            The second day of the Sports Week began amidst great verve. The Track and Field events for Std VIII and IX
            saw enthusiastic participation.

            The most awaited day of the Sports Week was its last day in which Inter School Team Sports were organised
            between Smt.MCP Sanskar Vidya Bhavan and JB Modi Vidyalaya. Volleyball, Kho- Kho and Kabaddi were for both
            Boys and Girls categories and Football was played under Boys' Category.

            Smt.MCP Sanskar Vidya Bhavan won 5 out of 7 games and lifted the coveted Championship Trophy. All the
            winners were felicitated on the victory stand with certificates.</p>
